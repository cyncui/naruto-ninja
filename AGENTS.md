# AGENTS.md

This file gives coding agents project-specific context. Keep it short and update it when workflows change.

## Project Overview

- Primary app or package: single-package Vite + React app; Naruto hand-seal camera playground (MediaPipe, Canvas 2D).
- Main entry points: `index.html` → `src/main.tsx`; `src/runtime/vision.worker.ts` (MediaPipe worker); `scripts/*.mjs` (build and maintenance scripts).
- Important directories: `src/runtime` (camera, recognition, recording), `src/pose` (hand geometry and feedback), `docs/data` (technique catalogue and its schema), `tests` (`node --test` unit tests, `tests/browser` Playwright specs).

## Architecture Notes

- Module boundaries: none configured in fallow yet.
- Generated or vendored code: `public/vision/` (copied by `npm run prepare:vision`), `dist/`, `docs/arena/candidates/` (archived design-review snapshots, ignored by fallow).
- Sensitive areas: camera permission and worker startup in `src/runtime/useCamera.ts` and `src/runtime/vision.worker.ts`.

## Commands

- Install: `npm ci` (Node 24+)
- Build: `npm run build` (runs `npm run check`, then Vite and prerender)
- Test: `npm run test:unit`; `npm run test:e2e` against the production build
- Typecheck: `npm run typecheck`
- Seal model evaluation: `cd training && uv run pytest` (parity with `src/runtime`), `uv run baseline.py`; regenerate fixtures with `npm run fixtures:training`
- Code health: `npm run fallow`, `npm run fallow:audit -- --base origin/main`

## Fallow

- Use `fallow audit --format json --quiet` before committing AI-generated changes.
- Use `fallow dead-code --format json --quiet`, `fallow dupes --format json --quiet`, and `fallow health --format json --quiet` for targeted checks.
- Use `fallow list --entry-points --format json --quiet` and `fallow list --boundaries --format json --quiet` to inspect project shape.

| When the agent is about to... | Run |
|---|---|
| delete an "unused" export or file | `fallow dead-code --trace <file>:<export>` |
| prove a TypeScript symbol's exact consumers before refactoring | `fallow dead-code --type-aware --symbol-impact <file>:<export-or-class.method>` |
| find how one module reaches another | `fallow trace --path <from> <to>` (Reports `reachable: false` instead of failing when no import path exists; type-only hops are reported, not skipped.) |
| delete an "unused" dependency | `fallow dead-code --trace-dependency <name>` |
| migrate a dependency | `fallow trace --dependency <name> --sites` (Counts each imported name, follows one hop through project wrappers, and counts each use that it cannot resolve.) |
| commit or open a PR | `fallow audit --base <ref>` |
| read a diff before approving it | `fallow review --base <ref> --brief` (orientation, never gates: deterministic and always exit 0, unlike the audit row) |
| prioritize refactoring | `fallow health --hotspots --targets` |
| ask who owns code | `fallow health --ownership` |
| check untested-but-reachable code | `fallow health --coverage-gaps` |
| consolidate duplication | `fallow dupes --trace dup:<fingerprint>` |
| find feature flags | `fallow flags` |
| check which architecture rules apply to a file before changing it | `fallow guard <files>` |
| check import cycles, boundaries and policy rules after changing code | `fallow architecture` |
| surface security candidates | `fallow security` |
| understand a finding | `fallow explain <issue-type>` |
| scope a monorepo | `--workspace <glob> / --changed-workspaces <ref>` (global flags, prefix any command) |

## Agent Rules

- Always ask before:
- Preferred style:

## Fallow checks

Use fallow for code-quality, cleanup, and setup tasks in this repository. Fallow checks the changed code before each `git commit` and `git push`. In Claude Code and Codex, a PreToolUse hook from `fallow agent install` runs this check and blocks the command when the verdict is `fail`. Other agents run the check themselves: `fallow audit --format json --quiet --explain --gate-marker agent`. If the verdict is `fail`, fix the reported findings before you try again. A JSON runtime error such as `{ "error": true, ... }` does not block.

Audit defaults to `gate=new-only`: only findings introduced by the current changeset affect the verdict. Inherited findings on touched files are reported under `attribution` and annotated with `introduced: false`, but do not block the commit. Set `[audit] gate = "all"` in `fallow.toml` to gate every finding in changed files.

For non-skill agents, treat the task map below as the local onboarding source: run the listed fallow command before destructive edits, before commits, and before pull request handoff.
